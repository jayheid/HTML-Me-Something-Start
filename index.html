      <h1>Hawaii Trip</h1>
      <p>
        My wife and I went to Hawaii for our Honeymoon in November 2023. We had
        both worked really hard with planning the wedding so we were eager to
        have a trip with plenty of exploration and relaxation to celebrate.

        <h3>Resort Life in Kailua-Kona</h3>
        <p>
          We began our trip with checking into our resort on Big Island. We
          enjoyed being able to see the mountain on the way to a hike each
          morning and relaxing by the pool with mai tai in hand for sunset.

        <h3>Pololu Valley and Waimea</h3>
        <p>
          We hiked in Pololu Valley on one of the first days in Big Island. The
          hike offered a great view of the coastline and a nice walk along the
          beach to view the valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ate at a restuarant called Fish and Hog in Waimea, which was some
          of the best food I had on the trip. The first time I got to try poke,
          and their poke nachos were incredible.

        <h3>Volcano National Park</h3>
        <p>
          We spent two days in Volcano National Park. We hiked around the park
          to look at the caldera, the lava tubes, and the rainforests
          surrounding the volcano. I was stuck by the extreme changes in
          environment from the desert in the immediate surrounding of the
          caldera and the lush rainforests that were were a bit beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had lodging at Volcano House, an historic hotel located in the
          park. One of my favorite features was a cozy fireplace which contained
          a fire that had never been extinguished. Much of the time relaxing
          before or after our hikes were spent reading in front of the fire.

      <h2>Kauai</h2>
      <p>
        After our time on Big Island we traveled to Kauai. Because this was the
        oldest island, so it was much greener than we had previously seen in Big
        Island.

        <h3>Na'Pali Coast</h3>
        <p>
          We did a boat tour around the Na'Pali Coast. We got to have great
          views of the coast line and snorkel in the water. We were also lucky
          enough to see dolphins on the cruise!

        <h3>Kipu Valley</h3>
        <p>
          One of the highlights of the entire trip was ATV tour through the Kipu
          Valley, a cattle ranch that served as the location where several
          Hollywood movies were filmed. It was a thrilling experience driving
          through all of the jungles and seeing all of the beautiful sights that
          the ranch had to offer.
